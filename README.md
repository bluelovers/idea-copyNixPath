# Overview: problem&rarr;solution.

I run my Idea under Windows but also have a Unix environment pointing to the same filesystem with Unix terminal
on it. Often have to pass file paths from Idea to the Unix terminal.

Since Idea runs under Windows, it copies me the Windows path with **backslashes**. Which causes problems with
my Unix shell scripts. I quickly cobbled this tiny plugin together and it's saving me a lot of grief with this.

What it does, it adds 2 actions and 2 menu items to the editor popup menus.
